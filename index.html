    <h1>Internet</h1>
    <h2>How does internet work?</h2>
    <p>
      There is no control center for the Internet.<br />
      Instead, it is a distributed networking system, meaning it is not
      dependent on any individual machine. Any computer or hardware that can
      send and receive data in the correct fashion (e.g. using the correct
      networking protocols) can be part of the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Internet's distributed nature makes it resilient. Computers, servers,
      and other pieces of networking hardware connect and disconnect from the
      Internet all the time without impacting how the Internet functions —
      unlike a computer, which may not function at all if it is missing a
      component. This applies even at a large scale: if a server, an entire data
      center, or an entire region of data centers goes down, the rest of the
      Internet can still function (if more slowly).

    <h2>How does a website work?</h2>
    <p>
      In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Each
      packet contains both data and information about that data. The information
      about the packet's contents is known as the "header," and it goes at the
      front of the packet so that the receiving machine knows what to do with
      the packet. To understand the purpose of a packet header, think of how
      some consumer products come with assembly instructions.
